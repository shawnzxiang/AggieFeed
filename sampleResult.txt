On February 5, 2015, UC Davis engineering students had the rare and exciting chance to chat with crew members of the International Space Station (ISS). Known as an "In-Flight Education Downlink," the event came through the courtesy of the Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Office of Education, in conjunction with JSC's Public Affairs Office. Such downlinks are designed to encourage K-16 students to study and pursue careers in all STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.

This UC Davis downlink was organized by MAE Professor Stephen K. Robinson, a former astronaut whose 36-year career with NASA included four shuttle missions and three spacewalks.
